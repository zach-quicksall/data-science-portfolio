# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains selected data science projects focused on real-world modeling problems, with an emphasis on **decision-making under uncertainty**, **systems dynamics**, and **applied machine learning**.

The projects span domains including healthcare, marketplaces, fraud detection, marketing, and text analytics, and are designed to reflect how data science is practiced in production settings.
