# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains selected data science projects focused on real-world modeling problems, with an emphasis on **decision-making under uncertainty**, **systems dynamics**, and **applied machine learning**.

The projects span domains including healthcare, marketplaces, fraud detection, marketing, and text analytics, and are designed to reflect how data science is practiced in production settings.

## Projects

### ECG Beat Classification
**Directory:** `ecg_beat_classification`

Supervised classification of ECG heartbeats using time-series signal data.  
Focuses on feature engineering for biomedical signals, class imbalance, and model evaluation beyond overall accuracy.

**Key themes:** time-series ML, healthcare data, model evaluation

---

### Fraud Detection Modeling
**Directory:** `fraud_detection_modeling`

End-to-end fraud detection pipeline for highly imbalanced data.  
Emphasizes PR-AUC optimization, threshold selection, review-rate tradeoffs, and operational metrics relevant to real fraud systems.

**Key themes:** imbalanced classification, XGBoost, decision thresholds

---

### Housing Market Dynamics
**Directory:** `housing_market_dynamics`

Analysis and modeling of housing market behavior, with attention to temporal and structural patterns in prices and supply.  
Explores how market dynamics converge and diverge over time.

**Key themes:** econometrics, market dynamics, exploratory modeling

---

### Urban Congestion Dynamics
**Directory:** `urban_congestion_dynamics`

Modeling congestion and breakdown regimes in an urban transportation marketplace.  
Includes regime detection, simulation-based interventions, and analysis of system stability under supply changes.

**Key themes:** systems modeling, simulation, congestion dynamics
